# HumanitZ
[HumanitZ] is a co-op, isometric, open world survival game in a world ended by the zombie outbreak. As one of the few human survivors, try to last as long as “humanly” possible. The past can't be changed, but you can make a difference today for the future of humanity.

**Note:**
- Connection to the server needs to be done through the Query Port
- The README in the installation notes a startup not used, this is because it currently does not work. Use the Startup tab to define the server name as it edits the Config file
