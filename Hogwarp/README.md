# HogWarp
[HogWarp] is a Work In Progress mod that adds Multiplayer functionality to Hogwarts Legacy, similar to FiveM for GTAV


This Mod requires a API key only obtainable through their Discord, see the Startup Variable **API KEY** for more info.
- Some features of the mod (Public servers / higher player counts) require a Patreon level. See their Patreon here: https://www.patreon.com/tiltedphoques

Plugins as of now **do not work** as Wine and Winetricks will break the DLL it runs off of. 
- This currently is being caused by a checksum issue from WineTricks using DotNet7; hopefully this will be removed from the README soon haha
